# nix_collection
Collection of various scripts for Linux/Unix type system use, even useful on cygwin.
Lots of Bash, some other items, all meant for CLI/script use.

Mostly for myself, a place to keep useful tidbits and libraries and such.
Each script usually has oirgin in some need i had somewhere, comments in each will indicate if that is the case. 
You will find stuff primarly made for Ubuntu and MacOS - see script comments for detail.
